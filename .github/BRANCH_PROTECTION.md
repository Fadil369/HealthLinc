## Implementation Guide

### 1. GitHub Repository Settings
Navigate to: Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Branches

### 2. Create Branch Protection Rules
1. Click "Add rule"
2. Set branch name pattern (e.g., `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`)
3. Configure protection settings as per the rules above

### 3. Configure Required Status Checks
1. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
2. Add required status checks from the list above
3. Enable "Require branches to be up to date before merging"

### 4. Set Up Code Owners
Create `.github/CODEOWNERS` file:
```
# Global owners
* @healthcare-team @security-team

# Backend services
backend/auth/ @auth-team @security-team
backend/claimlinc/ @nphies-team @healthcare-team
backend/payments/ @payments-team @security-team
backend/fhir-gateway/ @interoperability-team @healthcare-team

# Frontend
frontend/ @frontend-team
frontend/clinician-portal/ @frontend-team @healthcare-team

# Infrastructure and CI/CD
.github/ @devops-team @security-team
scripts/ @devops-team
docker-compose.yml @devops-team
wrangler.toml @devops-team

# Documentation
docs/ @docs-team @healthcare-team
README.md @docs-team
```

### 5. Configure PR Templates
Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:
```markdown
