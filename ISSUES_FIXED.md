# ✅ Issues Fixed - BrainSAIT-Unified Ready for Deployment

## 🐛 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **TOML Syntax Error** ❌ ➜ ✅
**Problem**: Unterminated inline array in `wrangler.toml` line 13
```toml
# ❌ BROKEN
vars = { 
  NODE_ENV = "production",
  LOG_LEVEL = "error"
}

# ✅ FIXED  
[env.production.vars]
NODE_ENV = "production"
LOG_LEVEL = "error"
```

### 2. **Durable Objects Error** ❌ ➜ ✅
**Problem**: Referenced `ChatSession` and `UserSession` Durable Objects not implemented
**Solution**: Commented out unused Durable Objects in `wrangler.toml`

### 3. **Wrangler Version** ❌ ➜ ✅
**Problem**: Outdated Wrangler CLI (3.114.9) causing compatibility issues
**Solution**: Updated to latest version (4.18.0)
```bash
npm install --save-dev wrangler@latest
```

### 4. **Asset Upload Failures** ❌ ➜ ✅
**Problem**: KV upload script failing due to TOML configuration errors
**Solution**: Fixed TOML syntax, now uploading successfully
